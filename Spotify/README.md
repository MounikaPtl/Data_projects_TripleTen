### Data

The dataset used for this project is an Excel file provided by TripleTen, containing public data scraped from the Shopify App Store:

- **shopify.xlsx**: This Excel workbook includes four sheets:
  - `apps`: Details of apps available on the Shopify marketplace.
  - `apps_categories`: A join table connecting apps with their categories.
  - `categories`: Categories of apps, with each app potentially belonging to multiple categories.
  - `reviews`: Review data for each app, including ratings, comments, and developer responses.

### Description

The project involves creating a Power BI report with multiple pages of dashboards and visualizations. The objective was to analyze the Shopify app ecosystem to identify key factors contributing to app success.

### Assumptions

- Data from Shopify is assumed to be accurate and representative of the current app landscape.
- The `shopify.xlsx` file is complete and consistent, with minimal missing or erroneous data.
- Column names and data types accurately reflect their intended content.

### Process

1. Analyzed the overall app landscape to extract key statistics and trends.
2. Investigated review data to understand factors impacting app success and user satisfaction.
3. Evaluated developer responsiveness and its influence on app ratings and overall performance.

### Findings

1. New apps typically receive ratings shortly after their launch.
2. A significant number of apps achieve high ratings.
3. Apps with developer responses tend to have higher ratings.
4. Reviews marked as helpful have an average rating of 5.48 stars.
5. The app maker "Elfsight" has the highest total rating score, with 135.10 stars.
6. "Pictorem" holds the highest average rating for helpful reviews, at 50.
