Project Requirements
Overview

This document outlines the requirements for analyzing raw transaction logs from an e-commerce website to derive business metrics. The goal is to create a conversion funnel, prepare data for cohort analysis, calculate retention rates, and organize the results in Google Sheets.
Part 1: Build a Conversion Funnel

    Create a New Sheet
        Add a new sheet to your Google Sheets document titled “conversion_funnel”.

    Construct a Pivot Table
        Use data from the “raw_user_activity” tab.
        Set up a pivot table to count unique users at each stage of the funnel:
            Stage 1: Product Page Views
            Stage 2: Shopping Cart Openings
            Stage 3: Purchases

    Add Conversion Rate Columns
        Calculate the total conversion rate (from product page views to purchases).
        Calculate conversion rates to the next step (e.g., from views to cart, and from cart to purchase) using formulas.

Part 2: Prepare Data for Cohort Analysis

    Filter Purchase Events
        Create a new sheet called “purchase_activity”.
        Filter the “raw_user_activity” data to include only purchase events.
        Copy the filtered data to the “purchase_activity” sheet.
        Verify that the sheet contains 4,845 rows (including headers).

    Calculate First Purchase Dates
        Create a new pivot table on a sheet named “first_purchase”.
        Configure the pivot table to calculate the minimum event_date for each user.
        Add a column named “first_purchase_date” in the “purchase_activity” sheet.
        Use VLOOKUP to populate the “first_purchase_date” for each user based on the data from the “first_purchase” sheet.

    Set Up Monthly Data
        Add three columns to the “purchase_activity” sheet:
            “event_month”: Use the TEXT() function to format as YYYY-MM.
            “first_purchase_month”: Use the TEXT() function to format as YYYY-MM.
            “cohort_age”: Use the DATEDIF() function to calculate the number of months between the first purchase and the event.

Part 3: Calculate Retention Rates

    Create Cohort Analysis Pivot Table
        Insert a new sheet called “cohort_analysis”.
        Set up a pivot table to group users by the month of their first purchase.
        Include the count of unique users for each cohort_age (0 to 4 months).

    Calculate Overall Retention Rates
        Create a new sheet named “retention_rates”.
        Design a table to calculate retention rates for each cohort by month.
        Use formulas to compute retention rates based on the cohort size and the number of users retained each month.

Part 4: Organize and Document Your Spreadsheet

    Executive Summary
        Complete the “Executive Summary” sheet with:
            Results: Summarize findings from the “conversion_funnel” and “retention_rates” sheets.
            Analysis: Explain the data assumptions and methodologies used.

    Reorder Sheets
        Arrange the sheets in the following order:
            “Table of Contents”: Include a brief description of each sheet.
            “Executive Summary”
            Analytical Results Sheets: “conversion_funnel,” “retention_rates,” etc.
            Calculation Sheets: “purchase_activity,” “first_purchase,” etc.
            Raw Data Sheets: “raw_user_activity”

    Formatting
        Format the spreadsheet for readability:
            Apply borders, bold fonts for headers, and consistent number/date formatting.
            Freeze rows, highlight cells with calculations, and ensure clear presentation.
