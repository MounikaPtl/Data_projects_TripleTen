## Section Titles and Descriptions

### Data

The dataset provided was a Google spreadsheet with raw transaction logs:

- **Business Analyst Project.csv**: Contains raw user activity logs.
  - **raw_user_activity**: Records each activity or event by a user on the company's website.
    - `user_id`: Unique customer IDs
    - `event_type`: Type of activity by the user
    - `category_code`: Category of the product being viewed or purchased
    - `brand`: Company that manufactures the product
    - `price`: Price of the product in USD
    - `event_date`: Date of the user activity in YYYY-MM-DD format
  - **Table of Contents**: Preformatted sheet for project organization.
  - **Executive Summary**: Preformatted sheet for summarizing results and analysis.

### Description

The final product is an 8-page Google spreadsheet, which includes:

- Raw data
- Processed data
- Data analysis
- Pivot tables

The goal was to analyze the company's raw transaction logs and convert event logs into actionable business metrics.

### Assumptions

- The "raw_user_activity" sheet accurately reflects all relevant website activity.
- Any missing values or inconsistencies in the data are minimal and considered negligible.
- The dataset's format (columns and data types) is correct and consistent.

### Process

1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**: Initial data review and preparation.
2. **Conversion Funnel Creation**: Built a funnel to understand user behavior from page views to purchases.
3. **Data Preparation for Cohort Analysis**: Filtered and organized data for cohort analysis.
4. **Retention Rate Calculation**: Analyzed retention rates across different cohorts.
5. **Finalization**: Enhanced formatting and documentation for clarity and presentation.

### Findings

| Results          | Synopsis                                                                                           |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Conversion Funnel | The conversion rate from clicks to purchases is 10%, indicating a substantial drop-off in the purchasing process. |
| Retention Rates   | For the cohort starting in September 2020, the retention rate was 12.5% after the first month, declining to 3% by the fourth month. |

- The websiteâ€™s conversion funnel reveals that while the transition from the shopping cart to purchase is relatively efficient, the overall conversion rate from initial page views to purchases is lower.
- Retention analysis shows a consistent drop in user retention over time, with notable exceptions in specific cohorts.
