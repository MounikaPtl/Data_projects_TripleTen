Project Requirements: Saving Super Store
Overview

This project involves analyzing sales and returns data from a superstore to identify key areas for profitability improvement and strategic advertising decisions. The goal is to provide actionable insights to help the store avoid bankruptcy.
Part 1: Profits & Losses

    Profit and Loss Centers Analysis:
        Identify the top two dimensions (e.g., subcategory + region, or shipping mode + product ID) with the highest and lowest profits.
        Create visualizations to justify which are the biggest profit centers and loss-makers.

    Product Discontinuation:
        Determine which products are underperforming and should be discontinued.
        Visualize data to support the decision for discontinuing certain products.

    Subcategory Focus:
        Identify three high-profit subcategories and three low-profit subcategories.
        Provide visualizations to recommend which subcategories to focus on and which to discontinue.

Part 2: Advertising

    Optimal Advertising Regions and Periods:
        Identify the top three combinations of states and months for advertising based on average profit.
        Create a visualization of the average profit for each month across these states.
        Justify advertising budget recommendations based on return on ad spend, suggesting a willingness to spend up to 20% of profits on advertising.

Part 3: Returned Items

    Return Rate Analysis:
        Transform the Returns table to make the "Returned" field a calculated field where "Yes" = 1 and "null" = 0.
        Create visualizations to identify:
            Products with the highest return rates.
            Customers with the highest return rates.

    Profit vs. Return Rate Visualization:
        Create a visualization showing the average profit against the average return rate, using a relevant dimension (e.g., state, shipping mode, product type).
        Provide a visual argument for whether the superstore should continue or cease business in relation to the chosen dimension.
