The analysis used the following dataset provided by TripleTen:

- **Superstore.xls**: Contains detailed records for products sold and returned items, with data from:
  - `orders`: Comprehensive details for each order.
  - `returns`: Details of each returned item.

### Description

- **Tableau Visualization:**
  - Comprises 10 pages with analysis, charts, and dashboards.
  - Aims to evaluate the storeâ€™s operations and enhance profitability to prevent bankruptcy.

### Assumptions

2. Identified key profit and loss centers.
3. Analyzed return rates and their impact on profitability.

### Findings

1. Identified sub-categories with varying success across regions.
2. Recommended discontinuing products with negative profits.
3. Suggested focusing on high-profit sub-categories.
4. Identified optimal advertising regions and time periods.
5. Noted products with a 100% return rate for discontinuation.
